# TODO

- draw something like a grey dashed line between the clicked point on the map and the real starting point of the route
- display some small (red?) points for each center selected in accessibility isochrone before they are computing
- use threading to fetch the result of accessibility isochrones when there is multiple center
- re-allow to fetch routing instructions
- use a nicer coloramp for isochrones
